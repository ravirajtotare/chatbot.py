# Simple Python Chatbot ðŸ¤–

This is a beginner-friendly Python chatbot built using simple `if-else` logic. It demonstrates basic natural language processing using string matching and user input handling in a terminal environment.

## Features

- Greets the user
- Responds to basic questions like:
  - Saying hello (`hi`, `hello`, `hey`)
  - Asking for the bot's name
  - Asking "how are you?"
- Ends the conversation with `bye`
- Prompts the user to rephrase unrecognized inputs

## How It Works

The chatbot continuously takes user input via the terminal and responds based on predefined patterns using `if-else` statements. The loop continues until the user types `bye`.

## Getting Started
